# fitness-watch / sleep-tracker
Started out making a fitness watch ... then built a sleep tracker.

## Hardware

I stacked these items ...

https://tinycircuits.com/collections/all/products/accelerometer-tinyshield

... and added a lithium-ion battery. Stuck it all in a sock, tied it to my wrist and went to sleep!
